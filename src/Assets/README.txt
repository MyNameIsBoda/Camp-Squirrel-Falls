Instructions for merging game

If importing Steam VR from scratch the following folders in our SteamVR have changes that are essiential to maintain:
-Assets/SteamVR/InteractionSystem/Longbow
-Assets/SteamVR/InteractionSystem/Poses

Overiding these will cause issues

Everything else in the SteamVR folder should be unchanged and okay to reimport (probably)
